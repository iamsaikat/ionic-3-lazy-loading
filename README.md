# Ionic 3 - Lazy Loading Modules/Routes

Ionic 3 introduced lazy loaded modules/routes, which allows us to have significantly improved performance. This means we no longer have to declare our page dependencies in our app.module.ts, instead - we can lazy load them when required.

### Installation:
Make sure you've installed the latest version of the Ionic CLI:
```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic
```
Clone or download and access this repo:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/iamsaikat/ionic-3-lazy-loading.git
$ cd ionic-app
```
Install node modules:
```bash
$ npm install
```
Test the App in your Browser
```bash
$ ionic serve -l
```
